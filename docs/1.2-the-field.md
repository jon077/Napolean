Basic moves are introduced in the field.  Napoleon walks across a field, jumping over a gaps and streams.

He jumps on floating platforms and gains points by eating broccoli, carrots and onions.

Rocks and fallen branches block his progress as he moves across the field.

The Jones' children are basic enemies that try and capture Napoleon.

* Boy - dumbly moves left/right.  When Napoleon jumps on him, he is squished and a blood pool spreads beneath him
* Girl - Skips in a annoying Rockwellian fashion, with pigtails you want to choke her with. Same blood pool when Napoleon squishes her

Touching either the children causes Napoleon to spin, fly up and then down to his death.

Hidden vines allow him to climb into the sky and walk along clouds, collecting bonus food scraps and skipping the hard parts of the level.
