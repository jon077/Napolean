## Scene 1.1 - The Meeting

*Animation Sequence*

Old Major gathers the animals by walking through the farm calling to each animal with a call to action speaking to the future "Commandments of Animalism"

Outside a big red barn, Old Major climbs up onto a make-shift podium of wooden boxes and addressed the animals.

The speech is a call to action to revolt against the humans.  The animals are charged and head back to the farm ready to revolt.

The intro follows Old Major to his stall in the barn, zooming out, the sun sets and rises over the barn three times.

As the sun sets on third night, Old Major passes and his spirit rises into the heavens.
