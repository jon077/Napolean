# Napoleon

*[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm](All animals are created equal.)*

Napoleon is an in-progress platform game about a pig named Napoleon.  Right now, the 
plot is not defined, except for the fact it will pull heavily from "Animal Farm".  
It should also be humorous, bloody, and in general inspired from "The Behemoth".


The original commandments are:

1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.
2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.
3. No animal shall wear clothes.
4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.
5. No animal shall drink alcohol.
6. No animal shall kill any other animal.
7. All animals are equal.


# Characters

* Napoleon:  The main character - an all around jerk dictator that 
* Squealer:  The narrator - a young pig with a strong political opinion about 
why the world is horrible
* Boxer:  The workhorse - stoic blue-collar, saves Napoleon in most levels


# Plot

## World 1:  The Revolution


The game starts with a meeting of the animals, lead by "Old Major" where the humans 
are established as enemies.  The meeting ends and the animals go back to the farm.
Three days later, Old Major dies.

The world is focused around the animals revolt and throwing out of the Jones.  Mr. Jones
is drunken and irresponsible.  He is the boss Napoleon defeats at the end of the level.

During the revolt, Napoleon protects and in turn Boxer drives Napoleon into the barn.  
The final battle scene between Napoleon and Mr. Jones takes place in the barn.

Upon winning the battle, the humans run off to another farmer and seek safety from 
the angry animals.  #pitchforksandtorches

The farm is renamed "Animal Farm" and "All animals are equal" is painted in large 
letters on one side of the barn.




## World 2:  Battle of the Cowshed

After a short period of gathering supplies and power, animals ambush a band of farmers 
coming to attack the farm.  The farmers quickly scatter before any damage can be
inflicted.  Several animals are gored and die quickly, splattering blood everywhere.

Napoleon must avenge their death and defends the farm defeating farmer after 
farmer in various scenes and mini battles.

The world ends with a rematch with Mr. Jones.  He has better weapons and significantly
harder to defeat.

Upon winning the battle, the animals celebrate Napoleon and he decrees, let's build 
a windmill!  With the decree a canon is fired ushering in his leadership.




## World 3:  The Windmill

The animals band together and build the windmill.  During this world, 
the "Commandments of Animalism" are emphasised as the animals build the windmill.
Napoleon is faced with fun physics problems and puzzles to climb the hill.  

Upon reaching the top of the hill, the windmill is put into operation and the "All animals are equal"
sign on the barn is lit up with vintage light bulbs.




## World 4:  The Storm

Fun sky level w/ the wind ripping and difficult moves to get back to the wind mill.
Napoleon gets close enough to the windmill to see it get destroyed.  Napoleon ends the 
level when he finds shelter in the base of the windmill.
