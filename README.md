## World 1: The Revolution  
  
  
### Scene 1.1: The Meeting  
  
The game starts with a meeting of the animals in the barn, lead by "Old Major" where the humans are established as enemies. Boxer the horse is by Old Major's side. He helps him to the podium where he gives a speech starting the revolution. The animals, shouting and demanding freedom, leave the barn. Boxer helps Old Major back to his bed.

### Scene 1.3 Throw Out Mr. Jones  
  
The final battle scene between Napoleon and Mr. Jones takes place in the barn.  
  
Upon winning the battle, the humans run off to another farmer and seek safety from the angry animals. **#pitchforksandtorches**  
  
The farm is renamed "Animal Farm" and "All animals are equal" is painted in large letters on one side of the barn. As the letters are being replaced the "Beasts of England" is played by the animal marching band.  
  
  
## World 2: Battle of the Cowshed  
  
  
### Scene 2.1 - Animalism  
  
Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. Napoleon visits the farm animals and speaks to each of them. With each visit, Napoleon gives them a scroll of the "Principles of Animalism". During each visit the animal repeats one of the Principles and comments on it.  
  
  
### Scene 2.2 - The Ambush  
  
The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health.  
  
After a short period of gathering supplies and power, animals ambush a band of farmers coming to attack the farm. The farmers quickly scatter before any damage can be inflicted. Several animals are gored and die quickly, splattering blood everywhere.  
  
  
### Scene 2.3 - Avenge  
  
Napoleon must avenge their death and defends the farm defeating farmer after  
farmer in various scenes and mini battles. Napoleon battles his way back to the barn.  
  
The world ends with a rematch with Mr. Jones. He has better weapons and significantly harder to defeat.  
  
Upon winning the battle, the animals celebrate Napoleon and he decrees, let's build a windmill! With the decree a canon is fired ushering in his leadership.  
  
  
  
  
## World 3: The Windmill  
  
  
### Scene 3.1 - The Chase  
  
During this world, the "Commandments of Animalism" are emphasized in an argument between Napoleon and the animals building the windmill, gets angry, and chases the animals through fun physics problems and puzzles to climb the hill. He stands like a human as he solves the puzzles.  
  
Upon reaching the top of the hill, the windmill is put into operation and the  "All animals are equal" sign on the barn is lit up with vintage light bulbs.  
  
  
### Scene 3.2 - The Storm  
  
On the hillside, Napoleon climbs into the trees and meets the animals. As he meets them, they either help him or not. If they do not, Napoleon kills them.
  
The wind is ripping, lightning crashing and rain falling foreboding.

As the level ends, Napoleon celebrates by changing the commandments to:

4.  No animal shall sleep in a bed  **with sheets.**
5.  No animal shall drink alcohol  **to excess.**
6.  No animal shall kill any other animal  **without cause.**

  
### Scene 3.3 - The Explosion  
  
Mr Frederick, a neighboring farmer, attacks the farm, using blasting powder to blow up the restored windmill. Although the animals win the battle, they do so at great cost, as many, including Boxer, the workhorse, are wounded.  

Mr Frederick is a mini-boss, once defeated, the animals realize Napoleon is a greedy dictator and drive him out. 
  
  
  
## World 4: Road to City Hall

### 4.2 - The Bridge

### 4.3 - The Coup
Joins the band, rocks out several songs, culminating with the animals coming to see him.  When they see him, they start throwing fruit and trash at the stage, but he continues to rock out.  As he rocks out, he realizes the error of his ways.

### 4.4 - The Redemption
After the show, the animals get aboard the bus.  Once every one is aboard, Mr Frederick tricks the bus driver and gets aboard the bus with plans to drive the bus off the bridge.  Napoleon hears their scream and Pixie Meat shouts for him to save them.  Realizing his destiny, Napoleon assumes the pig form and chases the bus through the city.   Racing through the city dodging obstacles, the chase ends on the bridge.

On the bridge, the animals witness the final showdown where Napoleon kills Mr Frederick by throwing him off the bridge.  As Mr Frederick falls off the bridge, he reaches out and grabs Napoleon by the ankles and they both die.
